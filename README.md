# The Tidyverse, Sociology 412/512

This repository will be used to complete thre lab assignments associated with the Tidyverse section of the [Practical Data Analysis in Sociology using R](https://practical-data-analysis-r.netlify.app/). You can follow the instructions below to get started.

## Becoming Tidyversant

The `tidy_script.R` script conducts two statistical operations on the earnings dataset we used in class. Unfortunately, the person who wrote the code did not use piping but instead nested functions inside functions. Replace the original code with code that accomplishes the same goal but uses piping. 

Keep in mind that you don't need to know all of the details of how each function works to transform them into a piping approach. Just take out the first argument when you pipe (because it is now being piped) and keep all of the other arguments.

When you are done, be sure all changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub and start an issue where you summon me with @AaronGullickson to let me know you are done.

## Making Pretty Pictures

Use the `make_picture.R` script to make a figure using `ggplot2`. The figure should show a relationship and should also have the following elements:

1. Use either color or faceting (or both) to add another dimension to the relationship.
2. Use good labeling on the figure so that a reader can understand what each variable is and how it is measured.

When you are done, be sure all changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub and start an issue where you summon me with @AaronGullickson to let me know you are done.
